### Predictive Modeling
**1. ABAV - Advanced Business Analytics and Visualization**
- **Title:** Improving Banking Customer Retention by Customer Churn Prediction
- **Description:** The problem statement seeks to improve banking customer retention by predicting churcn. The study will use a banking dataset retrieved from Kaggle and SAS Enterprise Miner to develop predictive models and identify causes of churn. The objective is to provide suggestions for reducing churn rate and improving customer relationship management.
- **Approach:** The work involves using machine learning to develop a predictive model for a dataset containing categorical and numerical variables. The dataset is split into training and testing data, explored through visualization and statistics, modified by encoding categorical variables and removing irrelevant features, and then used to develop two predictive models using logistic regression and artificial neural networks.
- **Result:** Suggestions were made to increase customer retention, such as knowing your customers through surveys and increasing customer satisfaction through on-premises services and customer engagement.
- **Skills:** SAS Enterprise Miner, Tableau, Statistics, Data Ingestion, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Machine Learning


**2. DAP - Data Analytical Programming**
- **Title:** Automation of Loan Approval Process Using SAS Programming
- **Description:** To demonstrate the development of a loan approval prediction model using logistic regression and SAS programming. The loan approval process is being automated to improve speed and accuracy, with the aim of enhancing customer retention rate and experience.
- **Approach:** SAS programming was utilized to develop the automated loan approval program, which included descriptive analytics to identify data trends and quality issues. The logistic regression algorithm was used to develop the prediction model, providing probability outputs for increased interpretability. Finally, the program automatically generates a report for each applicant using the output delivery system.
- **Result:** The program significantly accelerated the loan approval process, improving efficiency and productivity.
- **Skills:** SQL, SAS Studio, Statistics, Data Ingestion, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Machine Learning


**3. ML - Machine Learning**
- **Title:** E-Commerce Package Delivery Time Prediction Using Machine Learning
- **Description:** This study aims to develop prediction models using machine learning algorithms to predict the last-mile delivery time of shipping products as a classification problem of whether they are delivered on time or not. The objectives are to identify suitable algorithms, develop prediction models with hyperparameter optimization, and evaluate their performance against related works.
- **Approach:** The dataset used in this study is an e-commerce shipment dataset with 10999 observations and 12 variables. Four machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost, are used for prediction models. Evaluation metrics, such as confusion matrix, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, ROC, and Cohen's kappa, are used to measure the performance of the models. The exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing steps were performed, including identifying missing values, dropping and recoding features, factoring categorical variables, feature encoding, feature scaling, and train-test data splitting for model fitting and validation.
- **Result:** Multiple machine learning models were developed and compared to predict package delivery time, with optimized AdaBoost identified as the best performing model. The models outperformed those from previous literature.
- **Skills:** R, Machine Learning, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Statistics, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation.
