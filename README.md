**1.3 ML - Machine Learning** 
- **Title:** E-Commerce Package Delivery Time Prediction Using Machine Learning
- **Description:** This study aims to develop prediction models using machine learning algorithms to predict the last-mile delivery time of shipping products as a classification problem of whether they are delivered on time or not. The objectives are to identify suitable algorithms, develop prediction models with hyperparameter optimization, and evaluate their performance against related works.
- **Approach:** The dataset used in this study is an e-commerce shipment dataset with 10999 observations and 12 variables. Four machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost, are used for prediction models. Evaluation metrics, such as confusion matrix, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, ROC, and Cohen's kappa, are used to measure the performance of the models. The exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing steps were performed, including identifying missing values, dropping and recoding features, factoring categorical variables, feature encoding, feature scaling, and train-test data splitting for model fitting and validation.
- **Result:** The optimized AdaBoost model outperformed other models in this study and previous literature, achieving the highest accuracy of 69.82%. 
- **Skills:** R, Machine Learning, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Statistics, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation


**1.4 DL - Deep Learning**
- **Title:** Concrete Surface Crack Detection by Deep Learning
- **Description:** This study aims to develop an image classifier using deep learning to detect the presence of concrete cracks on images. The problem is that public image datasets available for such study are often produced in a laboratory setting, not reflecting realistic jobsite conditions. The objective is to introduce noise to the dataset to simulate photos taken on a jobsite condition.
- **Approach:** Using a dataset of 40,000 images with equal representation of cracked and non-cracked surfaces. The dataset is preprocessed through noise introduction, resizing, and pixel normalization, with the experiments focusing on the impact of noisy data on model performance. A simple CNN architecture with three convolutional layers and global average pooling is utilized, with learning rate and epochs as the main hyperparameters, and the models are evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision metrics.
- **Result:** A robust image classifier for concrete structural crack detection using data augmentation with noisy images were developed, achieving an accuracy of 99.22%, precision of 99.47%, and recall of 98.96%. The findings demonstrate that the integration of data augmentation improves the classifier's performance, making it suitable for real-world applications in structural inspection. A simple three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was sufficient to provide high accuracy results, comparable to deeper architectures.
- **Skills:** Python, Deep Learning, Image Data, Image Data Augmentation, Image Preprocessing, Hyperparameter Tuning, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Model Evaluation


**1.5 CP - Capstone**
- **Title:** Forex Market Price Prediction Using Multi-Time Series Analysis With Deep Learning
- **Description:** This study aims to design and develop a Forex price prediction model using deep learning techniques and multiple time series to produce highly accurate predictions of the next trading day's closing price. The objectives are to identify and implement suitable data preprocessing, design and develop price prediction models using deep learning algorithms and multiple timeframes, investigate and compare the predicted outputs with a baseline model, and evaluate the performance of the developed prediction models. Three different RNN-based models are developed, namely GRU, LSTM, and a feedforward neural network.
- **Approach:** The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets and segmented into seven timeframes. The sliding window method is used to represent the dataset for prediction, and hyperparameter tuning is performed for the GRU and LSTM models. Finally, the predicted outputs from the best performing models are combined using a feedforward neural network to produce the final prediction outcome.
- **Result:** The study compared the performance of LSTM-based and GRU-based models for Forex price prediction using different combinations of multiple timeframes. The results showed that the GRU-based models outperformed the LSTM-based models and that using two timeframes as predictors produced better results than using three timeframes. However, all models struggled to accurately predict price peaks and troughs during highly volatile market conditions. Proper selection of timeframe combinations is crucial for high prediction accuracy.
